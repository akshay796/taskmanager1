Project Description: Create a console-based task manager that allows users to add, view, and
manage their tasks. Users should be able to perform the following actions and task should be
saved in JSON file:
Add a Task: Users can add a new task by providing a task name, description, and due date.
View Tasks: Users can view all the tasks they have added along with their details, such as name,
description, and due date.
Mark Completed: Users can mark a task as completed.
Delete Task: Users can delete a task they no longer need.
Save/Load Tasks: Implement functionality to save tasks to a file and load tasks from the file
when the application starts.
Project Features:
Use classes to define the Task data structure.
Implement user-friendly console menus and input handling.
Use a list or array to store tasks during the runtime of the application.
Apply exception handling to handle invalid input gracefully.
Save tasks to a file using serialization (e.g., JSON or XML) to persist data between application
runs.
Use LINQ to sort and filter tasks based on their due dates or completion status.
Example Output:
---- Task Manager ----
1. Add a Task
2. View Tasks
3. Mark Completed
4. Delete Task
5. Exit
